# Major Project 
## Donors Choose: Proposal Acceptance Prediction

To predict whether or not a
DonorsChoose.org project proposal
submitted by a teacher will be approved,
using the text of project descriptions as
well as additional metadata about the
project, teacher, and school.

We have used the Donors Choose data to build a machine learning model that will classify whether a project will be approved and instead of just declaring if a project is more likely to get approved or not, our model will output a probability of how likely is project going to be approved.

## The project is deployed on [Heroku](https://donors-choose.herokuapp.com/)
